            Introduction

        <p class='text'>

          Contemporary LMMs often exhibit remarkable performance on existing visual benchmarks, yet closer inspection reveals persistent shortcomings in their ability to interpret and reason about visual content. Many existing benchmarks tend to become saturated, losing their value as effective measures of the true visual understanding capabilities of frontier models.

        </p>

        <p class="caption">
          Frontier LMMs score highly on many popular benchmarks, leaving little headroom. By comparison, our ZeroBench proves impossible for current models, leaving maximum headroom.
        </p>

        <p class='text'>

          Due to rapid progress in model development, the headroom on popular visual benchmarks is quickly eroded---in many cases the State of the Art (SotA) score improved each month.

        </p>

          Rapid progress was made on visual benchmarks last year.
        </p>

        <p class='text'>

          To provide a representative evaluation, benchmarks need to be high-quality and diverse. Moreover, with the rise of models that leverage test-time compute scaling -- and subsequently use more resources during inference -- there are strong incentives for benchmarks that are lightweight.

        Accuracy scores on the ZeroBench main questions and subquestions.

        <br>pass@5 and 5/5 reliability are based on 5 samplings at temperature=0.7 and top_p=0.95.<br>

            Findings

        <h2>
          ZeroBench is impossible for contemporary LMMs.
        </h2>

        <p class="text">
            On pass@1, all models score 0% on ZeroBench, failing to answer a single question correctly.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Some questions are within reach.
        </h2>

        <p class="text">
            We find non-zero performance in the pass@5 setting, with most models correctly answering 1-3 questions; this suggests some questions are slightly easier, and are just within the limits of the capabilities of some models. However, considering the 5/5 reliability metric for the same responses, the results are all 0%, indicating low consistency.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Subquestions differentiate model performance.
        </h2>

        <p class="text">
          There is sufficient signal in the subquestion scores to differentiate model performance. Claude
Sonnet 3.5 v2 is the best-performing model after scoring
24.30% pass@1 and answering 81 out of 334 subquestions
correctly. Although significantly less challenging than the
main questions, the models still struggle to
correctly answer these subquestions. On ZeroBench there is no
clear advantage of reasoning models over traditional models.
